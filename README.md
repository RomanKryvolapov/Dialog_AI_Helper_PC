# Dialog AI Helper

This is a PC application that can recognize voice, send messages to LLM models and receive responses in continuous mode

You can use this application to translate dialogue, or to provide prompts during a dialogue

Tested only under Windows

If you need a translation of the dialogue during the conference, you can make a virtual audio input 
and a virtual audio output and send the sound to the virtual audio output and simultaneously to your sound device, 
I did this using [VB-Audio VoiceMeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) audio mixer application
